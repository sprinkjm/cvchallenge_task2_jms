# cvchallenge_task2_jms
This package provides a very simple baseline solution to Task 2 of the catvehicle challenge.

# Install
Create or go into your catvehicle_ws, and make sure you have cloned the catvehicle and obstaclestopper packages into this workspace. 
```
cd catvehicle_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/sprinkjm/catvehicle.git
git clone https://github.com/sprinkjm/obstaclestopper.git
git clone https://github.com/sprinkjm/cvchallenge_task2.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Now you're ready to run 

# Running
```
cd catvehicle_ws
source devel/setup.bash
```
Run each of the following in its own tab (don't forget to source devel/setup.bash for each):
```
roslaunch cvchallenge_task2 catvehicle_custom.launch worldfile:=world1.worldfile
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun cvchallenge_task2_jms cvchallenge_task2_jms_node
```

Then monitor the /detections topic either from the cmd line or in rviz.
